Problem Statement: SMS Spam Classification
In the era of mobile communication, SMS (Short Message Service) has become an integral part of our lives, enabling quick and convenient communication. However, this convenience has also attracted the attention of spammers, leading to the proliferation of spam messages. The challenge lies in accurately identifying and classifying these messages as either legitimate ("ham") or spam.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and spam SMS messages. Given a dataset containing a collection of SMS messages labeled as "ham" or "spam," the task is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the class of an incoming SMS message based on its content.

The project involves the following key steps:

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: Acquire a dataset of labeled SMS messages, where each message is associated with a class label (ham or spam). Clean and preprocess the text data by removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the messages into words or phrases.

2.Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and word embeddings.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of ham and spam messages, identify patterns, and visualize the data to better understand its characteristics.

4.Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for text classification. Common choices include Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and more advanced techniques.

5.Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the chosen model. Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance on the validation set.

6.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. Compare the results with baseline models and select the best-performing model.

The success of this project lies in achieving a high accuracy in classifying SMS messages as ham or spam, thereby enhancing user experience by filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful content from their SMS inbox.
